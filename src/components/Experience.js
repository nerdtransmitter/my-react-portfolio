          <p className='px-5'>I recently graduated from <a href="www.lewagon.com">Le Wagon</a>, a 9-week intensive web development bootcamp in Paris. I am passionate about learning, which is why I quickly fell in love with coding. Before that, I graduated from Columbia University with a BA in psychology with a minor in visual arts. I wear many hats and like coding with both the UX in mind (where my psychology education comes in) as well as bringing a creative eye to designing beautiful websites.</p>
